Haiku Geometric Documentation
=============================

Graph Neural Networks in JAX
----------------------------

Haiku Geometric is a collection of graph neural network (GNN) implementations in `JAX <https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html>`_.
It tries to provide **object-oriented** and **easy-to-use** modules for GNNs.

Haiku Geometric is built on top of `Haiku <https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku>`_ and `Jraph <https://github.com/deepmind/jraph>`_.
It is deeply inspired by `PyTorch Geometric <https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric>`_.
In most cases, Haiku Geometric tries to replicate the API of PyTorch Geometric to allow code sharing between the two.

Haiku Geometric is still under development and I would advise against using it in production.
